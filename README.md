# FiletoVideo
Encodes a file to a video.

This code encodes any file to a video, shrinking the size enourmously. The idea is that this is used to store ZIP files on YouTube. 

Modify the code accordingly to your needs and filetype, it is very simple. The code on here is meant to be used with .zip archives.

To run the code, call main() with the file path as argument. For video functionality, you must have FFmpeg installed on your system.

There are a ton of bugs right now, and the code is much slower than optimal. I will add decoding ability and optimize later.
